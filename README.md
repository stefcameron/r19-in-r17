## Installation

Use the latest `node` and `pnpm` executables, and run `pnpm install` from the repo root.

## Running

1. Build the `react-19` bundle.
2. Run the `react-17` app.

Running `pnpm start` from the repo root will do all of the above and open a browser to the __react-17__ app running on port `3000`.

The `react-19` app can be run on its own by running `pnpm start:19` from the repo root. A browser will open to the app running on port `3001`.
